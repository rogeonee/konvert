# ðŸ“¨ Konvert

A simple and minimalistic website to convert images to most popular formats. Honestly, I can barely remember why I needed it in the first place â€” maybe it was for a profile picture somewhere that **had** to be a PNG, but all I had was a JPG. Who knows? The point is, all the image format conversion websites out there look like they are straight out of the 2010s: overly colorful, cluttered with *design* elements, and filled with a million unnecessary buttons. Itâ€™s like using a Walmart or Superstore self-checkout UI â€” which I deeply despise.

Lately, I've been diving more into **Next.js**, and I absolutely love Vercel's design philosophy: sleek, black-and-white, nothing distracting. Some might say it's dark and boring, but I don't see an issue with that. Creating 'fun' design without it being overwhelming or distracting is tough, and making it functional is even harder. I could have just gone with pure HTML and skipped styling altogether â€” but I'm not Ilya Sutskever.

So, I built **Konvert**. The UI is kept intentionally minimal, and **shadcn** was a big help. Its components were almost exactly what I was looking for, just a few tweaks here and there. Like the cockpit of a jet fighter, every button has a purpose.

The backend is still a WIP. It'll most likely be hosted on a **DigitalOcean Droplet VPS**. Iâ€™ve also been toying with the idea of making a Telegram bot, but for now, the website is my priority. Who knows, maybe Iâ€™ll forget about this little project in a couple of weeks.
